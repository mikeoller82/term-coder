suggest "improve error handling" # Get AI suggestions
repl                          # Enhanced REPL with completion
bookmark add auth src/auth/    # Create bookmarks
context add important.py       # Add files to context
history                       # Show command history
```

### Enhanced REPL Features
```bash
# Inside tc advanced ‚Üí repl:
ls                            # List directory with syntax highlighting
cat main.py                   # Display file with syntax highlighting
context add main.py           # Add file to working context
bookmark add home /path/to/project  # Create navigation bookmark
cd home                       # Navigate using bookmarks
session                       # Show session information
```
